**For all of the following, we pre-filter to only consider respondents in the 18-29 age group.**

I present all the graphs first stacked by gender to allow comparisons more easily,
and then the identical analyses side-by-side to visualise distributions better. 

## Stacked bar plots
I think the first question is strangely worded -- if I were dating someone
but it's not a "committed" relationship, I probably wouldn't say that I was "Single
or not currently in a relationship",
but I wouldn't fit into the "In a committed relationship, but not living together" 
category either.

```{r plots1a, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, out.width='80%'}
plot_question_by_gender_stacked(df, "Q1")
```

The next question is only asked to respondents who said
they were single or not in a relationship.

```{r plots2a, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, out.width='80%'}
plot_question_by_gender_stacked(df, "Q3")
```

The next question is only asked to respondents who 
said they were single or not in a relationship, and additionally
are not casually dating anybody.

``` {r plots3a, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, out.width='80%'}
plot_question_set_by_gender_stacked(df, "Q4", "Please indicate if each of the following is a reason or not a reason why you are not currently looking for a relationship or dates")
plot_question_by_gender_stacked(df, "Q13", "Even if you are not currently using an online dating site or a dating app, have you ever used an online dating site or a dating app?")
```

The next two questions are only asked to respondents who said
they had at some point used an online dating site or app.

```{r plots4a, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, out.width='80%'}
plot_question_by_gender_stacked(df, "Q14", "Have you ever gone on a date with someone who you met through an online dating website or  dating app?")
plot_question_by_gender_stacked(df, "Q15", "Overall, would you say your OWN personal experiences with online dating sites or dating apps have beenâ€¦")
plot_question_by_gender_stacked(df, "Q17", "When it comes to dating today, do you think it is...")
plot_question_set_by_gender_stacked(df, "Q21", "Read each statement and please say whether you agree or disagree with each one")
plot_question_by_gender_stacked(df, "Q24")

```

The next question is only asked to respondents who said they were not straight/heterosexual.

```{r plots5a, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, out.width='80%'}
plot_question_by_gender_stacked(df, "Q25", "How important is being [LESBIAN OR GAY/BISEXUAL/QUEER/ASEXUAL OR AROMANTIC] to you?")
```

## Side-by-side bar plots
I think the first question is strangely worded -- if I were dating someone
but it's not a "committed" relationship, I probably wouldn't say that I was "Single
or not currently in a relationship",
but I wouldn't fit into the "In a committed relationship, but not living together" 
category either.

```{r plots1b, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, out.width='80%'}
plot_question_by_gender(df, "Q1")
```

The next question is only asked to respondents who said
they were single or not in a relationship.

```{r plots2b, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, out.width='80%'}
plot_question_by_gender(df, "Q3")
```

The next question is only asked to respondents who 
said they were single or not in a relationship, and additionally
are not casually dating anybody.

``` {r plots3b, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, out.width='80%'}
plot_question_set_by_gender(df, "Q4", "Please indicate if each of the following is a reason or not a reason why you are not currently looking for a relationship or dates")
plot_question_by_gender(df, "Q13", "Even if you are not currently using an online dating site or a dating app, have you ever used an online dating site or a dating app?")
```

they had at some point used an online dating site or app.
